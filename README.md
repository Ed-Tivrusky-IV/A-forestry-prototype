## How to control the vehicle
* Please use wsad to translate and rotate
* Press space bar to fly the drone. While the drone is in the air, the vehicle's movement is deactivated.
* Press the M key to toggle the 360 view menu which is supposed to get updated each fly. However, the current 3 sets of images are just dummy content. Will update the 360 camera later.
* Use the left/right arrows to traverse the menu.

## Things to notice
To make the .glb models get rendered correctly, you need to download the glTFast package by:
* Open your Unity project.
* Navigate to Window > Package Manager.
* In the Package Manager window, click the Add (+) button on the status bar.
* Select Add package by name... from the dropdown menu.
* In the "Name" field, enter: com.unity.cloud.gltfast
* Click the Add button.
If you cannot find the prefab in your scene view.
